# shim-coil-direction-convention-routine

Jeff proposes that: Shim coils are wound such that a positive current generates an inward magnetic field.

For actual, physical coils, if the winding is mistakenly reversed, there will be a software flag (-1) to indicate that it is so.  The software flag will multiply the requested current so that the direction is corrected in software.  Another option is to switch the current leads, although sometimes this is not the most practical solution, because of the rat's nest of wires.
